# **App Name**: CardSnap Contacts

## Core Features:

- Camera Integration: Implement a camera view within the web app to allow users to take pictures of business cards.
- Text Extraction: Utilize OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to extract text from the scanned image of the business card.
- Data Parsing: Use an AI model tool to parse the extracted text and identify key contact information fields (name, phone number, email, etc.).
- Data Review and Edit: Display the parsed contact information in a clear, editable form for the user to review and correct any errors.
- Contact Creation Trigger: Provide a button or link that, when clicked on an iPhone, opens the native contact creation interface, pre-filled with the extracted and reviewed information. This could be achieved by creating a URL scheme or using a service like 'mailto:' or 'tel:' links where applicable.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: White or light grey for a clean background.
- Secondary color: A calm blue (#3498db) for primary actions and highlights.
- Accent: Green (#2ecc71) to confirm successful data parsing and contact creation.
- Clean and readable sans-serif fonts for all text elements.
- Simple, modern icons for camera, edit, and save actions.
- A single-column layout optimized for mobile viewing, with clear sections for each step (camera, review, save).
